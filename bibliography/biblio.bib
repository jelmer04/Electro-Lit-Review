    abstract = "A review on pulse and pulse reverse techniques for electrodeposition have been attempted. Pulse electrodeposition (PED) of some metals and alloys are reported. The effects of mass, transport, electrical double layer pulse parameters and current distribution on surface roughness and morphology are presented. Applications, advantages and disadvantages of \{PC\} and \{PRC\} techniques are discussed along with theoretical aspects and mechanism. "
