\section{Introduction}
Waveguides are used extensively in high-frequency electronics and can be applied in many engineering situations. This project considers waveguides applicable in the terahertz range of the electromagnetic spectrum, concentrating specifically on the manipulation and amplification of microwave radiation.

These waveguides are highly complex structures with extremely small dimensions (Often in the micron range), making them difficult and expensive to manufacture. Another complication in the fabrication process is the aspect ratio required (Usually required to be around 100 for optimal operation). The combination of these factors with the requirement for high quality surface finish and difficulty in using practical useful materials in creating the part make the manufacturing process extremely complex.

Current methods for manufacturing the discussed waveguides include:
